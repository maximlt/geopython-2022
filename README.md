Talk given a GeoPython2022 on the 20th of June 2022

## Install instructions

* Install conda with Anaconda or Miniconda
* Install `anaconda-project`, I suggest creating a new environment just for that with `conda create -n aproject python=3.9 anaconda-project
* Clone this repository with `git clone` and change the directory to the repo with `cd geopython-2022`
* Run `anaconda-project run` which will:
    * Download data create by the project
    * Create a conda environment with the required project dependencies
    * Launch the `geohvplot.ipynb` Jupyter notebook
